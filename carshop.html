 <h2>About Isuzu Australia</h2>
 <p>Isuzu Trucks have been market leaders of the Australian truck market* for 28 consecutive years, from 1989 - 2017, 
 and today approximately one in every four new trucks sold in Australia carries the Isuzu brand. (*Reference T-Mark December 2014).
Our promise to deliver a premium product to the Australian market has been proudly and consistently upheld. </p>

 <p>The measure of our commitment is reflected in the number of trucks on the road that bear our marque, and the number of successful companies relying on Isuzu trucks every day.
 When we talk about reliability, we're not just talking about trucks, but also about people and indeed our entire philosophy. 
 In addition to our in-house Customer Care Centre, customers also have access to an extensive range of service and support 
 programmes designed to ensure that Isuzu truck ownership is a positive and rewarding experience for all concerned.</p>
 
  <p>The rationale was to provide a specialized focus for the distribution and marketing of Isuzu LCV (Holden badged), and Isuzu Truck products in Australia.
In 2001, responsibility for the LCV business transferred back to Holden, allowing I-GM to concentrate entirely on the truck business.
In November 2005, following a series of negotiations, Isuzu Motors Ltd purchased all of General Motors' equity in I-GM and the Company was renamed Isuzu Australia Limited ("IAL"),
 a fully owned subsidiary of Isuzu Motors Ltd.</p>

  <p>The new ownership has enabled closer involvement of IAL with Isuzu Motors Ltd benefiting Isuzu truck customers in Australia, 
through our enhanced ability to specify and design a wide range of Isuzu trucks that suits just about every application in the Australian market.</p>
